# IKEA VATTENKAR Tool Holders

A simple 3d model for tool holders that clip onto the ikea vattenkar mini-shelves.

The tool holder model is defined using [openscad](https://openscad.org/) and can be easily adjusted for various tools by changing the width, depth and height parameters as well as the label.

## 3D printing

The model is suitable for 3d printing.
The examples pictured here were printed using Elegoo Centauri Carbon with Elegoo PLA filament.
Additional supports for the overhanding rear clip were generated using Orca Slicer.
